Today there are no certain methods by using which we can predict whether there will be rainfall today or not. Even the meteorological departmentâ€™s prediction fails sometimes. In this article, we will learn how to build a machine learning model which can predict whether there will be rainfall today or not based on some atmospheric factors.
